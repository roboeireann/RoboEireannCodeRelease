# RoboEireann code release 2024

This is the RoboEireann code release 2024, based on the [B-Human Code Release 2021](https://github.com/bhuman/BHumanCodeRelease/tree/coderelease2021) with RoboEireann specific modules and features added. The code release is a lightly cleaned up version of code used at RoboCup 2024.

To install, build, and run the software the instructions at the [B-Human wiki](https://wiki.b-human.de/coderelease2021/) for Ubuntu generally apply. The RoboEireann code release currently supports Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 22.04 only. We normally use command line tools to build and run the software so we do not guarantee that the integration of build or run related utilities currently works with any given IDE.
